        "# Problem Solving Agent (PSA) Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "The Problem Solving Agent (PSA) in this scenario is Rohan, who is designed to solve a path-finding problem on a campus layout. Its objective is to find a valid path from a given start state to a goal state (e.g., from \"Admission Office\" to \"Exit\") while visiting every node exactly once and minimizing the total travel cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Agent Components\n",
        "- **State Representation:**  \n",
        "  Each state is represented as a tuple:  \n",
        "  `(current_node, path, visited)`  \n",
        "  where:  \n",
        "  - `current_node` is the node currently being explored.  \n",
        "  - `path` is a list of nodes visited in sequence.  \n",
        "  - `visited` is a set of nodes that have been visited.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Transition Model:**  \n",
        "  The agent uses a transition model to generate successor states. For a given state, it examines the outgoing edges from the `current_node` in the graph. A successor is generated if the neighbor node has not yet been visited (or if it is the goal, to allow completion).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Goal Test:**  \n",
        "  The goal test function checks if the current state meets the following conditions:  \n",
        "  1. The `current_node` equals the goal node.  \n",
        "  2. All nodes in the graph have been visited (i.e., the size of the `visited` set equals the total number of nodes).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Search Algorithms:**  \n",
        "  The PSA incorporates multiple search algorithms to explore the solution space:\n",
        "  - **Greedy Best First Search (GBFS):** Uses a priority queue guided by heuristic values to quickly find a valid path.\n",
        "  - **Genetic Algorithm (GA):** Evolves a population of candidate paths to find a solution by exploring diverse solutions and escaping local optima.\n",
        "  - *(Optionally, Bidirectional Search or other methods can be incorporated.)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dynamic Input Handling:**  \n",
        "  The agent accepts dynamic input from the user to define the graph, and to specify the start and goal states.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Agent Architecture\n",
        "1. **Input Module:**  \n",
        "   - Reads user input for the number of nodes, node names, edges (with weights), and the start/goal states.\n",
        "2. **State Representation Module:**  \n",
        "   - Constructs and maintains the state in the form `(current_node, path, visited)`.\n",
        "3. **Transition Model Module:**  \n",
        "   - Generates successor states based on the current state's outgoing edges.\n",
        "4. **Search Module:**  \n",
        "   - Implements the search algorithms (GBFS, Genetic Algorithm) to explore the state space.\n",
        "5. **Output Module:**  \n",
        "   - Displays the found solution path, total cost, and performance metrics (runtime, memory usage).\n",
        "6. **Comparative Analysis Module:**  \n",
        "   - Provides a comparative analysis of the search algorithms based on dynamic performance measurements.\n",

The trade-off is that it may require more computational time and careful parameter tuning (population size, number of generations, mutation rate).\n",
        "- **Bidirectional Search** (if implemented) can significantly reduce search time by exploring from both the start and goal simultaneously, but it often requires more memory and can be more complex to implement correctly. The algorithm checks for an intersection between the forward and backward frontiers and immediately attempts to merge the paths when a common node is found. However, if the intersection happens early, for example, at a node that is reached before all nodes have been visited in either search, the merged visited set will have an incomplete visited set and, therefore, will not form a valid complete solution.\n"
